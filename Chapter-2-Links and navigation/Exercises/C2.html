            <p>Jin Kazama is a complex and central character in the Tekken series. Born into the Mishima bloodline, Jin
                is
                driven by a turbulent family history marked by betrayal and conflict. Possessing a unique blend of
                traditional martial arts and the Devil Gene, Jin seeks to end the cycle of violence that has plagued his
                family for generations. As a conflicted protagonist, he plays a pivotal role in the ongoing Mishima
                feud.</p><br>

            <h3 id="kaz">Kazuya Mishima</h3>
            <p>Kazuya Mishima, a pivotal figure in the Tekken universe, is marked by a tumultuous upbringing and the
                influence of the Devil Gene. Known for his ruthless and calculating nature, Kazuya has been both an
                antagonist and protagonist throughout the series. His struggles with inner demons, power struggles, and
                a desire for revenge make him a compelling and iconic character in the Tekken storyline.</p><br>

            <h3 id="jun">Jun Kazama</h3>
            <p>Jun Kazama is a mysterious and enigmatic character in the Tekken series, known for her spiritual
                connection with nature and her unique fighting style. As the mother of Jin Kazama, she plays a pivotal
                role in the Mishima family saga. Jun is portrayed as a gentle and serene warrior, contrasting with the
                tumultuous conflict surrounding the Mishima bloodline. Her quest for balance and harmony sets her apart,
                making Jun a symbol of tranquility in the midst of the chaotic world of Tekken. Despite her limited
                appearances in the series, Jun's influence on the storyline and her connections to the supernatural
                elements add depth to the overarching narrative.</p>
