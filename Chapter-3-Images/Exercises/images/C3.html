            <p>The coquette aesthetic is all about being girly, wearing dainty dresses, and accessorizing with cute pink
                bows.
                Although it is often embraced by teenage girls, people of all ages, races, sexualities, and genders can
                be
                coquette.</p>

            <p>First introduced in 1985 in Japan, Sylvanian Families are minimalist-looking animal figurines that are,
                according to the brand, timeless and classic toys that “promote wholesome family values”. The toys are
                best known for the “aesthetically pleasing” cottagecore attire they wear while they act out dramatic
                adult scenarios — like paying bills and getting divorced.</p>
